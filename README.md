# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Detection
Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects an individual's ability to communicate, socialize and behave appropriately in social situations. 
Early Detection of ASD becomes very essential.
In this project we have improved the accuracy and efficiency of screening and diagnosing the Autism Spectrum Disorder on Toddler using machine learning techniques.
